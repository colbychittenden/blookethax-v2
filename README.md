## About The Project

![Screen Shot](img/screenshot.png)

The original Blooket hack was discontinued by it's owner, and then the new owner is lazy and not updating it. That's where we come in, we are now updating Blooket hacks when no one else will!

## Built With

The Blooket hacks are still built with javascript, but we added a bit of html to make it easier

## Getting Started

This is how to start using the Blooket hacks for yourself!

* A non-managed browser
* The knowledge of how to install a chrome extension

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
